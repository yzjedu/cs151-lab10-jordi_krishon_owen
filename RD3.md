I was supposed to learn how to work with read data in file and create new data for file
Moreover, I was supposed to learn how to manipulate functions.

The steps I followed were to work through all the high level tasks, design functions to solve them, and run the functions in a main function. 
The techniques I used in this program was file reading, storing file data in list, and editing file lines.

My results matched what I expected to get after using different methods to solve high level tasks. 
I tried various test cases.

The challenge I faced the most was figuring out how to organize file data in the most optimal way. 
I did overcome them, and I did this by referring to class notes.

I worked on first half of code and my team should be designing the second half and reflection.
